 As a side note, I'd appreciate if you told me about any modified
versions/new games based on Formido. You are not legally required
to do that, but I'd like to try them out =) If you use any Formido's
code, it would be nice if I was credited.
And if you plan to put this game to a some sort of CD, please
let me know. I'd like to know where my game ends up.


--------------------------------------
2. WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS IT THEN?
--------------------------------- -- -
 
 Well, I'm glad you asked. It's a game... (surprise!)

 And yes, I can be more specific. Formido is one of those games,
where you are loaded with some guns and you go shooting different
things. 'Things' in this case are big, ugly, -
not green though - alien insects. The idea is to kill as many of
those bastards as possible. Eventually they will overcome you,
but struggle as long as you can. There are some power-ups to aid
you in your honorable quest. Keep in mind, that those critters
are rather tough and generally do nasty things when in close range
of any player-characters.


--------------------------------------
3. DOES IT HAVE ANY 'GAME PLAY'?
--------------------------------- -- -

 You should be playing by now, but since you're still here, I
might as well go on. First of all, the default keys:

	UP ARROW	Move forwards
	DOWN ARROW	Move backwards
	LEFT ARROW	Turn left
	RIGHT ARROW	Turn right
	RIGHT CTRL	Shoot
	RIGHT SHIFT	Special
	P		Pause the game
	F12		Save a screenshot

 The keys can be redefined within the game. Come to think of it,
Formido is my first game where redefining keys is actually possible
without altering the source code ;) Oh, and the 'special' key is
used when you want to throw the power-ups you have collected.
Speaking of power-ups, here they are:

	MEDIKIT		Increase your health
	BOMB		Just throw them and they explode
			when the fuse burns out.
	MINE		Mines activate when they stop
			sliding and deactivate after some
			time. Active mines explode if a critter
			walks over.
	MUSHROOM	Now this is weird. It gets your character
			on drugs(!). It gives you full health and
			the critters do less damage. It affects
			your vision too.. try 'em out!


--------------------------------------
4. TROUBLES GETS ALWAYS SHOT.. IMMORAL, NO?
--------------------------------- -- -

 Formido needs some power to keep up the desired 60 fps rate.
I would recommend something like Pentium II, 32 MB and fast
gfx-card.

 Formido supports all the major color-depths available:
8, 12, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bpp. It defaults to 16 bpp.
If a color-depth doesn't work, it will be emulated (which
is really slow). If the game is very slow, you could try
switching to 15 bpp mode. Open the 'formido.cfg' and change the

	video_mode_color_depth = 16
to
	video_mode_color_depth = 15 (or anything forementioned)

Other things that increase the performance:

* Disabling the sound (sound_enabled = 0)
  - speeds up a lot, especially on slower PCs
* Reducing the sound frequency (sound_freq = 22050)
  - might speed up a bit
  - you can reduce it as much as you want (22050, 11025, ...)
* Switching to 8 bpp (video_mode_color_depth = 8)
  - speeds up reasonably, especially on slower PCs

 Note that the game skips frames if your PC can't
update screen at 60 fps; the game still runs at right speed.

 By the way, it's not advised to run Formido in 24 or 32 bpp modes.
The graphical benefit is almost invisible, and the speed suffers
greatly. Stick with 8 or 15/16 bpp for the best speed. Don't even
bother to try the 12 bpp mode - chances are that your gfx-card won't
support it (so it's slow as hell).

 The best way to fine tune your config for the best speed, is to
enable the FPS-counter (show_fps = 1) and check how different
settings affect the fps.

6. COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT INFORMATION
--------------------------------- -- -

 Here are some words considering why I made this game.

 If you have played any Phobia freeware games you might experience
a sort of "deja vu"-feeling with Formido. I have always admired that
simple "nonstop-action"-approach taken in the Phobia-series. That's
one reason: I wanted to create a same kind of game. However, in my
opinion, Formido does have a slight tactical aspect present in the
game play. For example, you can throw mines and lure the critters
to walk over them. Btw, if anyone is interested, Phobia II is my
favourite (Phobia III is too slow and different overall).

 Another reason I can think of is learning to program with Simple
DirectMedia Layer (thereafter SDL). I have used Allegro-lib for
many years, and I wanted to try something different. Allegro is
very nice high-level game lib, whereas SDL is more low-level.
SDL does some things better than Allegro, and vice versa. However,
comparing them is waste of time (they're just so different). I
like them both though.

 Formido is written in C++. Version 1.0 contains around 7800 lines
of code (including comments).

 If you're desperately wondering "what the hell does 'Formido' mean?",
I can tell you that it's latin for 'fear' or 'dread'. Feeling better?

 Here are a few thoughts considering the possible next versions:
* Two player mode is planned
* Possible more power-ups (ideas welcome)
* Bug fixes are sure thing, should any arise

 If I get feedback about the game, I might continue developing
it, mainly things listed above. Btw, if you can program,
why don't you go and add some new things yourself; Formido
is GPL'ed after all. If you contribute something cool to the
game, I'd love to hear about it! And as always, if you do have
a brilliant idea considering the game, why don't you drop me
mail? =)

   That would be all, I guess.
   Enjoy the game!
