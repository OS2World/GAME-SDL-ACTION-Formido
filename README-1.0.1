Formido 1.0.1

Noe Falzon <noe.falzon@tiscali.fr>

-----------------------------
What's new in version 1.0.1 :
-----------------------------

- Corrected what was apparently a memory leak and prevented the game to run on
my machine...
- Highscore and config are now saved in ~/.formido. This folder is created the
first time the game is run.

- Ported to Mac OS X. See file INSTALL-1.0.1 in the source distribution if you 
want to compile Formido yourself.
