0. THANKS TO
--------------------------------- -- -

 Initially, the Linux version wasn't very
stable. I asked for help, and I surely
got some =)
I have listed the names of all persons
who sent me patches regarding the problems.
The names are in alphabetical order, and
sorry if I left someone out.

 Basically, you have the right to modify/use the game (and it's source
code) in any way you like. This includes all kinds of distribution,
modifications or even new games derived from the source code.
However, if you distribute any modified/derived work, you must
give your licensees (ie. players) the same rights as you have.
This means releasing your work under the GNU GPL.

 As a side note, I'd appreciate if you told me about any modified
versions/new games based on Formido. You are not legally required
to do that, but I'd like to try them out =) If you use any Formido's
code, it would be nice if I was credited.


--------------------------------------
2. INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SOURCE RELEASE
--------------------------------- -- -

 This package contains the Formido's Linux version source files,
which reside in /src and /include directories, and a Makefile
which can be used to build the game right away. Keep reading..


--------------------------------------
3. HOW TO BUILD
--------------------------------- -- -

 Before you can build the game, you must have following
libraries: (download them all from www.libsdl.org)

SDL (v1.2.5)
SDL_Mixer (v1.2.4)
SDL_Image (v1.2.2)

I have used the versions shown in parentheses, so your
best bet is to use those versions. This is not strictly
required, however. You can probably build the game with
other versions too, at least if they're newer than those
I used.

 After you have built and installed the forementioned
libraries, you can open your favourite console window,
and switch to the formido directory. After that, type:
$ make

..which builds the game. Now you're ready to go.


 That's all for now.
 Have fun! (and possibly learn a thing or two =)
