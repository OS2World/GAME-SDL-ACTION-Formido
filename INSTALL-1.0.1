Formido 1.0.1

Noe Falzon <noe.falzon@tiscali.fr>

This is the source distribution for GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.
It should compile as well on other Unix-like systems.

-------------------
General information
-------------------

Highscore and config are now saved in ~/.formido. This folder is created the
first time the game is run.

--------------------
GNU/Linux and others
--------------------

You must have SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer installed.

Run "make" in the formido directory.

Then formido has to be run from this same directory with "./formido". There is 
no installation at this time.


--------
Mac OS X
--------

If you just want to play the game, the precompiled binaries are enough and 
already contain all the required libraries.

To compile the game, you must have SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer installed as 
frameworks under the directory /Library/Frameworks (if they are in 
~/Library/Frameworks, you'll have to modify the Makefile)

Rename Makefile into whatever you want, such as Makefile.old, and rename 
Makefile.osx into Makefile.

Then run "make" in the formido directory. This will compile the game and make a 
bundle containing all the data, default config file, and required libraries, so 
you can redistribute it on computers where the libs are not installed.

The icon may not appear immediately. Copy the bundle somewhere else, and it 
should be updated.
